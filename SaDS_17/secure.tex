\section{Preliminaries}

\begin{definition}[polynomial-time algorithm]
 An algorithm $A$ is called polynomial time algorithm iff there exists $k\in \mathbb{N}$ such that the maximum number $t$ of operations $A$ has to perform for input of length $n$ satisfies $t(n)\in O(n^k)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[A probabilistic polynomial-time algorithm]
 A probabilistic polynomial-time algorithm (PPT) is a polynomial-time algorithm that might be non-deterministic. If it is deterministic we will just call it polynomial time algorithm.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
 A function $f:\,\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{R}$ is called negligible iff $$\forall k\in\mathbb{N}.\,\exists N_k\in\mathbb{N}.\,\forall n\geq N_k:\,n\left|f(n)\right|<1.$$
\end{definition}

One important cryptographic primitive is the so called one-way function (OWF). Using these one-way-functions one can build provably secure symmetric encryption algorithms. However, it is currently not known whether there exist any one-way function. In the following we will especially consider one-way permutations (OWP), bijective OWFs with identical input and output length. 

\begin{definition}[One way function]
 A function $f:\{0,1\}^*\to \{0,1\}^*$, is called a one-way function iff, $f$ is a PPT and for any natural number $n$ and any PPT $A$, there is a negligible function $neg$ such that: $$\mathrm{Pr}\left[f(A(f(x),1^n))=f(x)\right]\leq neg,$$ where $x$ is chosen uniformly random.
\end{definition}
Intuitively, OWFs are simply hard to invert PPTs. Some functions that are commonly believed to be OWFs are modular exponentiation and the multiplication of big prime numbers.

Another important concept is the so called Pseudo-random generator (PRG or PRNG). 
\begin{definition}[PRGs]
 A function $H:\{0,1\}^*\to \{0,1\}^*$ is called PRG iff:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item $H$ is a PPT
  \item There exists a PPT the so called \emph{length extension function} $l:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$, s.t. $\forall n\in\mathbb{N}.\,l(n)>n\land \left|H(x)\right|=l(\left|x\right|), \forall x\in\{0,1\}^*$
  \item There is a negligible function $neg$ s.t. for any PPT $A$, we have:
  $$\left|\mathrm{Pr}\left[A(H(U_n))=1\right]-\mathrm{Pr}\left[D(U_{l(n)})=1\right]\right|<neg(n),$$ where $U_k$ denotes a uniformly random element of $\{0,1\}^k$. 
 \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

It can be shown that given any OWF, we can build a PRG. %TODO: Insert a proof for at least OWPs using hard core bits
%This part should probably be moved to the appendix
\begin{definition}[hard-core bit]
 Let $f$ be a one-way function. Now the function $b:\{0,1\}^*\to\{0,1\}$ is called a \emph{hard-core bit} for $f$ if $b$ is computable in polynomial time and there exists a negligible function $neg(n)$ such that for any $n\in\\mathbb{N}$ and any PPT $A$:
 $$\mathrm{Pr}\left[A(f(x),1)=b(x)\right]\leq\frac{1}{2}+neg(n), $$ where $x\in\{0,1\}$ uniformly random. 
\end{definition}

The next step is to find one-way functions (assuming that there are one-way functions at all) for which we can build hard-core bits. 
\begin{theorem}
 Let $f$ be a one-way function. Define $g:\{0,1\}^{2n}\to\{0,1\}^*$ as $g(x\circ y)=f(x)\circ y$, where $\left|x\right|=\left|y\right|=n$. Then $g$ is a one-way function with hard-core bit $$b(x,y)=\bigoplus_{i=1}^n x_i\land y_i=\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_iy_i (\mod 2).$$
\end{theorem}
If now $f$ was a one-way permutation, we can use the above construction to get an additional pseudo-random bit, so we already have a pseudo-random generator.

\section{Asymmetric Encryption}

The idea behind RSA is that if $N=p\cdot q$ for large prime numbers $p$ and $q$, it is very difficult to compute $p$ and $q$ from $n$.

\subsection{RSA}

\paragraph{Setup}
Choose two large primes $p$ and $q$ (typically of roughly equal size).
Put $N=p\cdot q$.

Now put $n=(p-1)(q-1)$. (Actually, any common multiple of the two numbers is fine.)
Note that $n=\phi(N)$.
Pick $e\in Z_n$ such that there is a $d\in\Z_n$ with $e\cdot d\Equiv_n 1$.
Such a $d$ exists if $\gcd(e,n)=1$ and is easy to compute (see Thm.~\ref{thm:math:extendedeuclid}).

The keys are defined as follows:
\begin{compactitem}
 \item public information (encryption key): $N$ and $e$
 \item private information (decryption key): $n$, $d$, $p$, and $q$
\end{compactitem}
Among the private information, only $N$ and $d$ are needed later on.
So $n$, $p$, and $q$ can be forgotten.
But they have to remain private---$p$ (or $q$) is enough to compute $n$ and $d$.

Different keys are often compared by their size.
That size is the number of bits in $N$.

\paragraph{Encryption}
Messages are numbers $x\in F_N$.
For example, we can choose the largest $k$ such that $2^k<N$ and use $k$-bit messages.

Encryption and decryption are functions $\Z_N\to \Z_N$ given by
\begin{compactitem}
 \item encryption: $x\mapsto x^e\modop N$
 \item decryption: $x\mapsto x^d\modop N$
\end{compactitem}

These are indeed inverse to each other:

\begin{theorem}
For all $x\in Z_N$, we have $(x^d)^e\Equiv_N (x^e)^d \Equiv_N x$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
In general, because $N=p\cdot q$ for prime numbers $p$ and $q$, we have that $x\Equiv_N y$ iff $x\Equiv_p y$ and $x\Equiv_q y$.

So we have to show that $x^{de}\Equiv_p x$.
(We also have to show the same result for $q$, but the proof is the same.)
We distinguish two cases:
\begin{compactitem}
\item $p|x$: Then trivially $x^{de}\Equiv_p x\Equiv_p 0$.
\item Otherwise. Then $p$ and $x$ are coprime.\\
   By construction of $e$ and $d$ and using Thm.~\ref{thm:math:extendedeuclid}, we have $k\in\N$ such that $e\cdot d+k\cdot n=1$.
   Thus, we have to show $x^{de}=x\cdot (x^{p-1})^{k\cdot(q-1)}\Equiv_p x$.
   That follows from $x^{p-1}\Equiv_p 1$ as known from Thm.~\ref{thm:math:fermatlittle}.
\end{compactitem}
\end{proof}

\paragraph{Attacks}
To break RSA, $d$ has to be computed.
There are $3$ natural ways to do that:
\begin{compactitem}
 \item Factor $N$ into $p$ and $q$. Then compute $d$ easily.
 \item Compute $n$ using $n=\phi(N)$ (which may be easier than finding $p$ and $q$). Then compute $d$ easily.
 \item Find $d$ such that $e\cdot d\Equiv_n 1$ (which may be easier than finding $n$).
\end{compactitem}
Currently these are believed to be equally hard.

It is believed that there is no algorithm for factoring $N$ that is polynomial in the number of bits of $N$.
That is no proved.
There are hypothetical machines (e.g., quantum computers) that can factor $N$ polynomially.

Note that checking if $N$ can be factored (without producing the factors) is polynomial, and practical algorithms exist (in particular, the AKS algorithms).
That is important to find the large prime number $p$ and $q$ efficiently.
\medskip

If there is indeed no polynomial algorithm, factoring relies on brute-force attacks that find all prime numbers $k<\sqrt{N}$ and test $k|N$.
Therefore, larger keys are harder than break to smaller ones.
Because of improving hardware, the key size that is considered secure grows over time.

Keys of size $1024$ are considered secure today, but because security is a relative term, keys of size $2048$ are often recommended. 
%It is quetionable that 1024-bit rsa is really secure, even though it has not yet been publicly broken;
%(see for instance https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_%28cryptosystem%29#Integer_factorization_and_RSA_problem or https: //www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2007/05/307digit_number.html).
Larger keys are especially important if data is needed to remain secure far into the future, when faster hardware will be available.
